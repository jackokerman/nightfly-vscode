# Nightfly for VS Code

A dark VS Code color theme with syntax colors from [vim-nightfly-colors](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-nightfly-colors) and UI chrome inspired by [Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme).

## Install

Clone the repo and symlink it into your VS Code extensions directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackokerman/nightfly-vscode.git ~/nightfly-vscode
ln -s ~/nightfly-vscode ~/.vscode/extensions/nightfly-vscode
```

Then open VS Code, go to the command palette, select "Preferences: Color Theme," and choose **Nightfly**.
